## MarketWatch
A tiny replacement app for Meta Trader's market watch

## How to use?
Just open it as Administrator. For closing, just double click on the watch.

## Why run it as administrator?
MarketWatch uses `w32time API` to synchronize your time to windows server time, 
The reason is your time maybe wrong and synchronizing it to windows server will help to see correct time on the watch without any delay.
